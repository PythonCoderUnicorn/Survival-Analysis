## Intro to Survival Analysis


Survival data are from _time-to-event_ data, with a `start` and `end` time.

- time from surgery to death
- time from treatment to progression

Survival analysis is used in various fields, and has various names 
[reliability, duration, event history, time-to-event] analysis

**censoring** occurs if a subject has NOT experienced the event of interest by the end of data collection

subject censoring may happen due to:

  - loss to follow-up
  - withdrawal from study
  - no event by end of study

these are _right censoring_

## Variables & Formula

The necessary variables in order to know :

- $Y_i$ observed time
- (delta_i) $\delta_i$ event indicator
- subject $i$ 

formula for observed time:

- $T_i$= event time
- $C_i$ = censoring time

$Y_i$ = min($T_i$, $C_i$)

event indicator:
```
if ( event time < censoring time)
then delta_1 = 1


if ( event time > censoring time)
then delta_1 = 0
```

The probability that a subject will survive beyond any given specified time

- $S(t)$ = survival function, conditional probability of surviving beyond that time, given that an individual has survived just prior to that time. 

Survival probability is estimated as 
`number of patients who are alive (no loss to follow-up at time)`
/
`number of patients who were alive just prior to that time`

- $F(t)$ = $Pr(T <= t)$ cumulative distribution function

$S(t)$ = $F(t)$ = $Pr(T <= t)$ = 1 - $F(t)$

In theory the survival function is smooth; in practice we observe events on a discrete time scale.


The **Kaplan-Meier** estimate of survival probability at a given time is the product of these conditional probabilities up until that given time.

at time 0, survival probability = 1 $S(t_0)$ = 1


## Packages

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages(c("survival", "lubridate", "ggsurvfit", "gtsummary", "tidycmprsk"))
# remotes::install_github("zabore/condsurv")
# remotes::install_github("zabore/ezfun")

library(survival)
library(lubridate)
library(ggsurvfit)
library(gtsummary)
library(tidycmprsk)
library(condsurv)

```


## Lung Dataset

The `lung` dataset is from {survival} package.

- time: observed survival time in days
- status: censoring status, 1= censored, 2= dead
- sex: 1= male, 2= female

standard practice is to have 1= event, 0= censored

status == event

```{r}
# head(lung$status)

lung = lung %>% 
  mutate(status = dplyr::recode(status, `1` = 0, `2` = 1) )

head( lung[ , c('time','status','sex')])
```



## Survival objects & curves

The Kaplan-Meier method is the most common way to estimate survival times and probabilities. It is a non-parametric approach that results in a step function, where there is a step down each time an event occurs.


There will be one entry for each subject that is the survival time, which is followed by a `+` if the `subject was censored`. Letâ€™s look at the first 10 observations

```{r}
Surv(lung$time, lung$status)[1:10]
```

subject 1 had an event at time 306 days
subject 2 had an event at time 455 days
subject 3 was censored at time 1010 days


The survfit() function creates survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method based on a formula.

```{r}
surv_curv = survfit( Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung)

str(surv_curv)
```

time: the timepoints at which the curve has a step, (1+ event occurred)
surv: the estimate of survival at the corresponding time


## Kaplan-Meier plots

The {ggsurvfit} package works best if you create the survfit object using the included ggsurvfit::survfit2() function, which uses the same syntax to what we saw previously with survival::survfit(). The ggsurvfit::survfit2() tracks the environment from the function call, which allows the plot to have better default values for labeling and p-value reporting.

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
survfit2( Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data= lung) %>% 
  ggsurvfit()+
  ggplot2::labs(
    x="Days", y="Overall survival probability"
  )+
  ggdark::dark_mode()+
  add_confidence_interval()+ 
  geom_ribbon(col='pink', alpha= 0.2)
  # add_risktable( )
```



## Estimating Survival

One quantity often of interest in a survival analysis is the probability of surviving beyond a certain number of years, x.

remember that time in this dataset is in days

```{r}
summary( survfit( Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung), times = 365.25)
```

We find that the 1-year probability of survival in this study is 41%.

**caution**: ignoring censoring leads to overestimate of the survival probability



```{r}
survfit( Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung) %>% 
  tbl_survfit(
    times = 365.25,
    label_header = "**1-year survival (95% CI)**"
  )
```



## Estimating median survival

Another quantity often of interest in a survival analysis is the average survival time, which we quantify using the median. Survival times are not expected to be normally distributed so the mean is not an appropriate summary.

```{r}
survfit( Surv(time, status)  ~ 1, data = lung)
```

We see the median survival time is 310 days
